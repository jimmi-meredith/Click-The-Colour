Click the colour and not the word... easy right?

This is a side project I've been working on. it orginated as a basic project just to test some things using vanilla Javascript when I first started out. 
Since starting, I have chosen to build on it and turn it into a full-stack project since learning new technologies. 
This is a work in progress which I am very excited about.
